# Instructions To Run 2048 AI (Updated: 5/1/2019)
# Imports used/needed: tkinter, numpy, time, random
# In order to launch the application. Navigate in a command prompt or terminal to the folder that contains the game_menu.py script.
# Launch the game_menu.py script in a command prompt by typing "game_menu.py" and the game will automatically play with the configured heuristic.
# In order to change the heursitic, you can open the game_menu.py script, scroll to the main method in the bottom and comment/uncomment what heursitic you'd like to run. The comments in the code will provide more information.
# You can change the speed that the AI program runs by editing the global variables at the top of the game_menu.py file. The variable you want to change is, "loopDelay". Default = 100ms or 1/10 of a second per loop. Another example you can use is: loopDelay = 1000 (1000ms or 1 second per loop)
